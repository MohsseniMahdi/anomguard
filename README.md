# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a growing concern in the digital age, costing businesses and individuals billions of dollars each year. As technology advances and online transactions become increasingly common, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in payment systems. This highlights the critical need for advanced and reliable fraud detection systems that can protect sensitive financial information and mitigate losses for consumers and financial institutions alike.

In this project, we are a team of five aspiring data scientists united in our goal to develop an effective and efficient credit card fraud detection solution. This project is part of our final data science coursework, showcasing our ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges. Using the comprehensive [Kaggle dataset on credit card fraud detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/code?datasetId=310&sortBy=voteCount), we aim to explore the complexities of detecting fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.

The Kaggle dataset provides anonymized data from European cardholders, featuring 31 attributesâ€”including principal component analysis (PCA)-transformed features, transaction time, and amount. The dataset represents a typical fraud detection scenario, where the number of fraudulent transactions is significantly lower compared to genuine transactions. This class imbalance introduces additional challenges, as it necessitates strategies to prevent models from favoring the majority class at the expense of detecting rare, yet critical, fraudulent instances.

## Objectives

Our project seeks to achieve the following objectives:
1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain an in-depth understanding of the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
2. **Address Class Imbalance:** Implement techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE) to handle the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features and evaluate their impact on model performance while ensuring interpretability and relevance.
4. **Model Development:** Build and compare the performance of various machine learning models, including supervised and unsupervised algorithms, to identify fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using a variety of metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to ensure robustness.
6. **Scalability and Applicability:** Design a fraud detection pipeline that can be scaled to real-world applications and adapted to changing patterns of fraudulent behavior.

## Impact and Significance

The significance of this project lies in its potential to contribute to the ongoing battle against financial fraud. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this project not only underscores the critical role of data science in solving practical problems but also demonstrates our ability to tackle complex issues like class imbalance and interpretability in fraud detection. Through rigorous analysis, innovative solutions, and a commitment to ethical practices, we aim to present a framework that can inspire further advancements in the field of fraud detection.

In addition to its technical contributions, this project serves as a testament to our collective efforts, teamwork, and passion for data science. It marks a significant milestone in our journey toward becoming proficient and impactful data scientists.
